              Excellent service from Flower Shop. Individual handling their Facebook messages was prompt and professional. All communication was clear and top-notch. The flowers were delivered on time with automated receipts for payment and delivery. My biggest source of satisfaction is the fact that what you see is what you get!

              The flowers were actually of good quality but the service is why I would not recommend this company. I had a bouquet of white roses delivered for my Mum’s birthday and she wasn’t home when the delivery arrived. The person delivering the flowers were extremely rude to the help who received the delivery. Do take this opportunity to improve your service and train your staff in delivering proper customer service. I don’t appreciate your staff being rude to our help and hope you take this seriously.

              Fantastic service. I ordered from London. Within 3 hours, a lovely fresh bouquet was delivered to my family's home. Really impressed, will be ordering again. Thank you for your fantastic service and quality!
